# Apex Quiz Game
Apex Quiz is a basic quiz game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The purpose of this particular quiz is to test the user on their basic knowledge of the game Apex Legends. 
I understand that not everyone who finds this quiz will know about Apex, with this in mind I have also linked my previous project in the About/Help section on the landing page this allows the user to prepare themselves for the quiz.

## Wireframes
Before I started any of the coding I first created some wireframes for how I envisioned the project to look.
* __Landing Page Wireframe__
    * At first I didn't put much thought into a seperate landing page until my mentor mentioned the idea of linking my previous project, the landing page will also give the user a small heads up of sort on what they should expect from this quiz.
    * Along with the text information there will also be a button that when clicked will take the user to the quiz page

    * The plan for the actual game was quite simple, there would be an outlined game area with the question, answers, score and everything else within this game area.
    * I also plan on there being a home button which will allow the user to return to the landing page.
