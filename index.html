        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>You already know this quiz is based on Apex Legends but what you don't know
            is all the questions are based around information from a website I previously created called
            <a class="gamers-guide" href="https://github-harrison.github.io/Gamers-Guide/" target="_blank">Gamers Guide</a>
            which is just a begginers guide to everything apex.
        </p>
        <p>If you've never played Apex Legends before I highly recommend checking out
            <a class="gamers-guide" href="https://github-harrison.github.io/Gamers-Guide/" target="_blank">Gamers Guide</a>
            just to prepare yourself before taking the quiz as you're more likely to get a higher score with the
            information the site provides.</p>
