            <h1>Welcome to my Apex Legends quiz!</h1>
            <p>This quiz is based on a free to play battle royale game which I enjoy spending my free time playing.
               <br> If you are an Apex Legends player or want to get straight into the quiz feel free to click the button below 
                and begin answering the questions!
            </p>
            <p>However, if you have never heard of Apex Legends or would like to prepare yourself for the quiz scroll down to the 'Help' section 
                where there is some useful information.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- section to go to the quiz -->
        <div class="grid-item">
            <a href="quiz.html"><button><h2>To Quiz!</h2></button></a>
        </div>

        <!-- help section for users who aren't familar with Apex Legends -->
        <div class="grid-item">
            <h2>Help</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this quiz is to test how well you know the game Apex Legends, if you're like me then you should be able to score quite high.
                <br> But judging by the fact you're currently reading the help section i'm guessing you are either new to Apex or have no idea what it is and that's okay.
                <br> Below I will explain how you can prepare for the quiz and what type of questions you will come across.
            </p>
            <h3>How to prepare</h3>
            <p>
                Nobody likes to be unprepared for a quiz especially if it is a quiz on something you don't know, but you're in luck because I am about to provide you with
                a cheat sheet of sort.
            </p>
            <p>
                I say of sort as it's less like a sheet and more like a literal website that I had created previous to this quiz and as such this quiz is based
                with the information provided in my guide in mind.
                <br> Thus meaning if you were to check out the guide found here <a class="gamers-guide" href="https://github-harrison.github.io/Gamers-Guide/" target="_blank">Gamers Guide</a> 
                you could give yourself an advantage over 
                the people who dove straight into the quiz.
            </p>

            <!-- below is just a small preview of what the user can expect to find in the quiz -->
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>Now you know where you can find some of the information needed to get a good score on the quiz, let me tell you what type of questions you can expect.</p>
            <p>
                For the most part these questions are all just general knowledge an Apex player should know such as:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>How many guns the player can use.</li>
                    <li>What type of characters there are.</li>
                    <li>What items can be found in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                All questions provide you with 4 possible answers, some questions will also provide an image of an item or character and at the end
                you will be able to save your score and try again to get an even higher score (the score is saved locally so you will not see other peoples scores).
