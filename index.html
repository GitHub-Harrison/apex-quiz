            <h1>Welcome to my Apex Legends quiz!</h1>
            <p>This quiz is based on a free to play battle royale game which I enjoy spending my free time playing.
               <br> If you are an Apex Legends player or want to get straight into the quiz feel free to click the button below 
                and begin answering the questions!
            </p>
            <p>However, if you have never heard of Apex Legends or would like to prepare yourself for the quiz scroll down to the 'Help' section 
                where there is some useful information.
            </p>

        <div class="grid-item">

        <div class="grid-item">
            <h2>Help</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this quiz is to test how well you know the game Apex Legends, if you're like me then you should be able to score quite high.
                <br> But judging by the fact you're currently reading the help section i'm guessing you are either new to Apex or have no idea what it is and that's okay.
                <br> Below I will explain how you can prepare for the quiz and what type of questions you will come across.
            </p>
            <h3>How to prepare</h3>
            <p>
                Nobody likes to be unprepared for a quiz especially if it is a quiz on something you don't know, but you're in luck because I am about to provide you with
                a cheat sheet of sort.
            </p>
            <p>
                I say of sort as it's less like a sheet and more like a literal website that I had created previous to this quiz and as such this quiz is based
                with the information provided in my guide in mind.
                <br> Thus meaning if you were to check out the guide found here <a class="gamers-guide" href="https://github-harrison.github.io/Gamers-Guide/" target="_blank">Gamers Guide</a> 
                you could give yourself an advantage over 
                the people who dove straight into the quiz.
            </p>
            <h3>Questions</h3>
            <p>Now you know where you can find some of the information needed to get a good score on the quiz, let me tell you what type of questions you can expect.</p>
            <p>
                For the most part these questions are all just general knowledge an Apex player should know such as:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>How many guns the player can use.</li>
                    <li>What type of characters there are.</li>
                    <li>What items can be found in the game.</li>
                </ul>
                These are just a few to help you understand what information you might want to take in from the guide.
